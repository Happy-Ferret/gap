	* TerminalParser_Linux.m: imported a patch by Jeff Teunissen, Backbone:
	Terminal interpreted certain UTF-8 code sequences wrong, like e2 95 9b
(U+255B, which the bug transforms into e2 95 94).
	It turns out that it's due to the Linux console emulation,
which interprets the 0x9b character (CSI, which is ESC with the high order
bit set) to begin a control command.
	Change the terminal emulation to only switch into command scanning mode if we aren't in the middle of a multi-byte character (that is, if iconv says
it's not done processing the current character 0x9b is just a byte to be
consumed). This is the only 8-bit character that the console treats specially, so
this should be a complete fix.
