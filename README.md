The GNUstep Application Project delivers you the tools to improve 
your GNUstep workspace experience. Applications and utilities for 
your desktop, frameworks and tools for the developer.

The GAP Charter
---
The purpose of this project is to implement a set of administrative 
applications, user level applications and supporting framerks using 
GNUstep and for GNUstep.

These applications create together a workspace or desktop environment.

Our goal is for each application, tool or framework, if possible, to:

* support maximum portability to all GNUstep supported platforms, 
  including Windows
* create a corresponding Cocoa/Mac port: this is very useful for 
  many applications that are then available natively on Mac and helps 
  testing and comparison of the application against Cocoa
* support of the widest range of compiler versions, minimum dependency 
  requirement
* allow the usage without requiring other GAP framework and 
  applications or, if, a minimal set of them

The project aims to gather applications, besides original writing of them, through:

* Porting existing OPENSTEP/Cocoa/Mac applications, which are already 
  Free Software, to GNUstep
* Port OPENSTEP/Cocoa applications which are nowadays abandoned, 
  by speaking to the former companies, attempting to open their source code
* Rescueing existing applications which are abandoned and suffer bitrotting 
  and keep them maintained and improved. If possible a port to Cocoa is also attempted

Cooperation with companies about older applications has been proved difficult, 
but we encourage anybody to contribute by asking and poining out to existing 
software and by contacting current and former developers.
