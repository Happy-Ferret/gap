\fs24 \cf0 TimeMon gives a graphical representation of where the CPU cycles are going. Version 4.0 was basically the OPENSTEP port of TimeMon3.2, there were no new features. TimeMon 4.1 is the port to GNUstep and should be usable on a number of systems including Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD. Version 4.1 was ported also to MacOS X 10.1 or later, continuing the OPENSTEP and Rhapsody tradition.\

\fs24 \cf0 There are three general usages of CPU time under Unix.  System time is that time spent within the kernel.  User time is that time spent executing a user\'d5s programs, but not within the kernel.  Nice time is user time that has been set to a low priority.  There is also one other type of CPU time \'b1 idle time.  This is time during which there is no productive work to do, so your machine essentially twiddles its thumbs at a high speed.\

\fs24 \cf0 Lucky enough, the NeXT supplies four \'d4\'d4colors\'d5\'d5, which maps well to the four types of timing information.  Black is for system time, dark gray for user, light gray for nice, and white for idle time.  You can change these colors using the \'d4\'d4wells\'d5\'d5 at the top of this panel.\

\fs24 \cf0 TimeMon displays this information within the program\'d5s icon.  There are three rings displayed.  The innermost ring is updated according to the Update Period, which specifies the number of seconds between updates, and Lag Time which specifies how many update periods should be averaged together for the innermost ring.  The middle ring is an average of the last Layer Factor update periods, and the outer ring is an average of the values over the course of the square of the Layer Factor update periods.  The values in the fields are automagically stored in the user\'d5s defaults database.\

\fs24 \cf0 The difference between Lag Time and Layer Factor are subtle but useful.  Both values cause the program to average information over some period of execution, resulting in a more stable display.  Lag Time should give a short amount of time useful to even out the \'d4\'d4bumps\'d5\'d5 on the innermost ring.  A Lag Time of zero can result in a very dynamic display.  A similar effect could be achieved by increasing the Update Period.\

\fs24 \cf0 TimeMon has been extensively tuned to use as few CPU cycles as possible.  But, if you feel the need to pause it, click the Pause menu item.  Otherwise, adjust your Update Period to a higher value so that it updates less often
