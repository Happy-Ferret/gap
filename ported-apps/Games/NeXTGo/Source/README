                   NeXT version by John Neil

This program is a port of the GNU GO program by Man L. Li that utilizes the
window GUI interface of the NeXT computer.  To make moves on the board the
human player only needs to click the mouse button while the cursor is
pointed at the appropriate place on the board.

The computer moves are all generated utilizing the basic methodology of
GNU GO.  However, there is one major addition to the GNU GO system.  This
addition is an automated scoring algorithm.  These routines remove the
obviously dead stones from the board and then count the score.  A group is
considered dead if it surrounds no territory and, if removed, the squares it
covers would be owned by the opposing color.  There is still room for
improvement in this algorithm to remove those groups which only have one eye
and are, therefore, also dead.

This program also allows you to read and generate smart-go files.  This is
increasingly becoming the standard format for game storage on computer.  It
is a flexible format which allows for nested variations and can be a valuable
format for storing educational examples.

This program now also contains a client for the Internet Go Server.  This
client currently works through sockets and thus requires an actual internet
connection.  Future plans may include support for connecting via SLIP and/or
modem.  The client allows you to play on the IGS simply by clicking on the
board and features a browser for the selection of games to observe.
