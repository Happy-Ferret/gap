You need a medium-sized TIFF/PNG/JPEG file to play this game.

Left-click and drag to move a piece or cluster.
Ctrl-left-click and drag to connect knobs to slots.
Right-click to disassemble a cluster.
Ctrl-right-click to extract a piece from a cluster.

Drawing can be slow; this is because GNUstep's implementation of
NSWindow does not have the method "cacheImageInRect."

It can be difficult to manipulate two pieces that are very close
together. It helps to move one of them so that they are at a greater
distance.
