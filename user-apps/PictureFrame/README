About PictureFrame.app
======================

PictureFrame.app is an application meant to be run on your own home-built
digital picture frame (e.g. an old laptop you've taken apart and mounted in
a nice picture frame). Its a picture viewer for people who want more.
After all, if you have this big powerful computer in your picture frame,
it should be able to do more than just display photos! PictureFrame.app
does do more. At the bottom of the screen, it will display an information
frame containing a clock (digital or analog), information about the photo
being displayed and the current weather and forecast! PictureFrame.app is
expandable, and in the future, people might add more features.

It's possible it could be used as a screensaver as well, but it's not really
set up for that. 

Features:
========
- Displays any photos in the 'Pictures' subdirectory.
- Reads iPhoto database
- Can select photos in directories/iPhoto Albums that match a substring
- Monitors computer temperature and turns off if computer gets too hot
- Optional display of time, weather and photo information
- Set the delay between pictures


Setting Up PictureFrame.app
===========================

Read the PICTURE_FRAME file for general information on how to set up a
digital picture frame. Then come back here.

You should have already compiled and install PictureFrame.app by now. If
not it's easy enough:

make
make	(FIXME: currently you have to run make twice. Still working on that)
make install

(you might have to do the install as sudo or root).

PictureFrame.app tries to read pictures from the "Pictures" subdirectory
of your home directory. If any subdirectory of Pictures contains iPhoto
albums, PictureFrame.app can read the album information and only display
photos described in the album database (set the Album default to "Albums"
for this to happen, or set it via preferences.)

There's nothing else you need to do at this point, but you can use the
preferences to set up things the way you want. For instance, if you want
to display the weather, you will have to set your Zip/Postal code to 
display weather for the right area. In full-screen mode, you can bring up the
preferences with Command-, (and remove it using the same keys).
