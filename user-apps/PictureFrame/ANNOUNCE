PictureFrame version 1.1.0 is available.

PictureFrame.app
======================

PictureFrame.app is an application meant to be run on your own home-built
digital picture frame (e.g. an old laptop you've taken apart and mounted in
a nice picture frame). Its a picture viewer for people who want more.
After all, if you have this big powerful computer in your picture frame,
it should be able to do more than just display photos! PictureFrame.app
does do more. At the bottom of the screen, it will display an information
frame containing a clock (digital or analog), information about the photo
being displayed and the current weather and forecast! PictureFrame.app is
expandable, and in the future, people might add more things it can do.
